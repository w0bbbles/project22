# Evention
The application is an events listing webpage. There are many events that goes on, on a  weekly basis. Many of which fly under our radar unless it is a annual recurring event, some of which that aren't but do lack the marketting prowness tend to fly by without our notice if we are not looking for such specific genre of events like a dog adoption drive by that is gone after a weekend of planning.

The application aims to give all event planners a plateform to advertise their unique events, all in one page that others would patronise and have a higher likely-hood of checking the user's event out as well as many others over the calendar year.
